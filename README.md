# Student Admission Prediction using keras

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented a neural network model using keras for the prediction of student's admission dataset.

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Student_Admission_Prediction_using_keras/blob/master/studentdata.csv)  
The first columns is the label (0 implies fail, 1 implies admitted) and 3 input features (gre, gpa, rank).

## Installation
* pandas  
<code>conda install pandas</code>
* numpy  
<code>conda install numpy</code>
* matplotlib  
<code>conda install matplotlib</code>
* keras  
<code>conda install keras</code>

## Accuracy
Test score = 0.775

## Issue/Bug
Please open issues on github to report bugs or make feature requests.

## Contribution
If you are interested in improving the code, please open an issue first to describe the task you are planning to do. For small fixes (a few lines of change) feel free to open pull requests directly.
